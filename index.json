This paper presents a lightweight acceleration-based fall detection method that can be implemented on edge devices. The proposed method uses Autoencoders, a type of unsupervised learning, within the framework of anomaly detection, allowing for network training without requiring extensive labeled fall data. One of the challenges in fall detection is the difficulty in collecting fall data. However, our proposed method can overcome this limitation by training the neural network without fall data, using the anomaly detection framework of Autoencoders. Additionally, this method employs an extremely lightweight Autoencoder that can run independently on an edge device, eliminating the need to transmit data to a server and minimizing privacy concerns. We conducted experiments comparing the performance of our proposed method with that of a baseline method using a unique fall detection dataset. Our results confirm that our method outperforms the baseline method in detecting falls with higher accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Unsupervised Fall Detection on Edge Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"I joined 4th International Workshop on Event-Based Vision, one of CVPR workshops.

One common approach to deblurring is to use deconvolution to cancel out the blur effect, but this method is limited by the difficulty of accurately estimating blur kernels from blurred images. This is because the motion causing the blur is often complex and nonlinear. In this paper, a new method for estimating blur kernels is proposed. This method uses an event camera, which captures high-temporal-resolution data on pixel luminance changes, along with a conventional camera to capture the input blurred image. By analyzing the event data stream, the proposed method estimates the 2D motion of the blurred image at short intervals during the exposure time, and integrates this information to estimate a variety of complex blur motions. With the estimated blur kernel, the input blurred image can be deblurred using deconvolution. The proposed method does not rely on machine learning and therefore can restore blurry images without depending on the quality and quantity of training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method can estimate blur kernels even for images blurred by complex camera motions, outperforming conventional methods. Overall, this paper presents a promising approach to motion deblurring that could have practical applications in a range of fields.","tags":[],"title":"Event-based Blur Kernel Estimation For Blind Motion Deblurring","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Our paper “Unsupervised Fall Detection on Edge Devices” has been accepted to MVA 2023 held in Hamamatsu, Japan.
